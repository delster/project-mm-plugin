# Project MM Plugin

## What is this?

This plugin contains the code needed on WP's side to serve MyMythos.com headlessly to a GatsbyJS front-end.

## How do I use this?

You don't, but feel free to copy/edit/clone/steal/whatever if it helps you in your own projects.

## How do I contribute?

Please don't. If you feel the need to, you can fork this and make a PR but it will probably be closed without discussion. This is a client-specific plugin.
